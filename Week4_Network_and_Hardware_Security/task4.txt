Task4: repeater
When I send the request, dvwaSession ID increases by one if multiple sent fast. If I take a little break between
sending, ID increases by more than one. Think that's because some other people can also increase it.

Task4: brute force
2 attemps were successful. Content of 2 attemps had longer length and had text "Welcome to the password protected area admin"
and failed attempts had "Username and/or password incorrect."
